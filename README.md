# Life Buddy (Beta)

Welcome to the official website for **Life Buddy**.  
This site is the central hub where all “Buddy” tools will come together. It’s still early, but just like the Chrome extension, the website will keep growing with new features and improvements.

## What it does right now

- Serves as the home base for Life Buddy users
- Shares updates on new features and releases
- Acts as the starting point for all upcoming “Buddy” modules

## What’s coming next

I’m currently working on expanding the website with:

- **Calendar & Scheduler** – organize your study sessions and daily tasks
- **Progress Tracking & Streaks** – keep motivated with milestones and stats
- **Buddy Modules** – expand beyond study sessions into focus, wellness, and accountability
- **User Dashboard** – view your sessions, progress, and personalized tools in one place
